This repository contains my work on Andrej Karpathy's
[Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero) course from lecture 2 onwards.

* My work on the first lecture is in a separate repository,
[`neural-net-fun`](https://github.com/toolness/neural-net-fun).

* My work on lectures 2, 3, 4, and 5 is in the
  [`python`](python) subdirectory.

* I skipped working on lecture 6 because I was impatient
  and wanted to get to transformers ðŸ˜…

* My work on everything else is in the [`gpt`](gpt) subdirectory.
